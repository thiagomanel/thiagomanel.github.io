I'm a professor at the Federal University of Campina Grande (associated with the Systems and Computing Department) since 2016. I hold B.Sc (2008), M.Sc (2010) and PhD (2016) degrees in Computer Science, from the Federal University of Campina Grande. During my M.Sc studies, I was a visiting student at the NetSysLab lab of the University of British Columbia, advised by Matei Ripeanu. My research interests lie in building distributed systems, evaluating their performance and applying them to solve e-science problems.
